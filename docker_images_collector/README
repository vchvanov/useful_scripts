What was the main idea?

We have in the Lab Linux VM per one or two setups with docker based containers
Every container is used for managing setup system.

Periodically we perform changes in these containers and in case of any Lab issues (vCenter issue, power outages and etc)
we're under risk to loose these changes

This tool is saving container state, performing it's backup, which stores on separate Linux VM (from which tool is executed)
We've added it to Linux VM cron to be executed once per week

Prerequisite for the script, which is not mandatory - to have Apache installed and running on the Linux VM
If you don't use / don't want to use Apache, you'll need to replace '/var/www/html/' with any other directory you need

Tool design

docker_images_collector.py           - main script
docker_images_collector_functions.py - collection of functions used in the script
docker_images_collector_hosts.txt    - storage of input data

In docker_images_collector_hosts.txt : setup must be equal to docker container name
